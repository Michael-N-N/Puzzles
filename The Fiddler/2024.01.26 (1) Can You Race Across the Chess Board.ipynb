    "A very tiny Alice is racing across a 2-by-2 chessboard, as shown below, where each smaller square has a side length of 1 cm. Alice starts at the bottom-left corner of the bottom-left black square and is trying to reach the top-right corner of the top-right black square.\n",

Her speed on the white squares is 1 cm per minute (again, she’s very small), while her speed on the black squares is 0.9 cm per minute.What’s the least amount of time it will take her to reach the finish?"

As the map is symmetrical the point $x$ has the same relative position to the finish as to the start (after a 180° rotation.) \n",
