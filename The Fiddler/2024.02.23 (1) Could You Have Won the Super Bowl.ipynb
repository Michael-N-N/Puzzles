    "And so, this week, it’s your turn to play coach. Football is complicated, so let’s assume a simplified scoring model. (Because this is just a model, our goal here isn’t necessarily to vindicate San Francisco’s coach, but rather to have fun with some of the math involved.)\n",

    "Every time your team is on offense, suppose there’s a 1-in-3 chance they score a touchdown (which we’ll say is worth a total of 7 points, as we won’t bother with 2-point conversions here), a 1-in-3 chance they score a field goal (worth 3 points), and a 1-in-3 chance they don’t score any points (i.e., they punt or turn the ball over on downs). After any of these three things happens, your team will then be on defense.\n",

    "Now, here’s how overtime will work: Your team is on offense first. No matter how many points your team does or does not score, the other team then gets a chance at offense. If the game is still tied beyond this point, the teams will continue alternating between offense and defense. Whichever team scores next wins immediately.Again, your team is on offense first. \n",
