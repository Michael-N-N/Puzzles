    "The next day, you open the carton again to find that the positions of the eggs have somehow changed — or so you think. Perhaps the Easter Bunny was snooping around your fridge?\n",
    "\n",
    "The 12 slots in the carton are arranged in a six-by-two array that is symmetric upon a 180-degree rotation, and the eggs are indistinguishable from each other. How many distinct ways are there to place two eggs in this carton? (Note: Putting two eggs in the two leftmost slots should be considered the same as putting them in the two rightmost slots, since you can switch between these arrangements with a 180-degree rotation of the carton.)"

The second case are positions where a 180° rotation does not change the position and hence, we do not need to correct for double counting. To count the positions from the second case, the position must be symmetrical to the centre:  The eggs have to be in different rows and on different (horizontal) sides of the centre. The distance of the column to the centre must to be the same. Hence, the number of positions from the secons case are equal to the number of slots left or right to the centre: $n/2$. \n",
